Right-click the ZIP in your downloads folder and you will be given many different options, the one we're looking for will either be called
"Extract All" or "Extract Here". Click on which ever you see, and extract it to a folder of your choice.
From there open the extracted folder, run the "RUN_ME_FIRST.py" file, wait for it to close and then run the "main.py".
Enjoy!
